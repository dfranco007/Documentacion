Throughout this Final Degree Project has been made a parallel implementation with OpenMP of an aproximation of level set algorithm for image segmentation. The purpose of this segmentation is to extract some features of the images to be segmented necesaries for the client of this project. 

Furthemore, a preliminary study of the existing types of segmentation techniques has been made and experimental tests have been performed with the parallelization made, so that one could check the impromevent realized against serial algorithm.

\textbf{Key words}: parallelization, OpenMP, \textit{level set}, segmentation, image.
